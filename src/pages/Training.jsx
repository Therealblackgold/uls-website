                In order to improve a security service, well-structured and
                manpower, training is essential to get the best out of each and
                every staff in the field. All security personnel as a condition
                of employment, fully conversant and must abide by the
                regulations as set out by the Private Security Regulatory
                Authority. Our success depends on recruiting the right person
                for the job. It is therefore imperative that each officer be
                matched to the clientâ€™s requirements and expectations.

                We offer our guards rewards for reporting any criminal activity
